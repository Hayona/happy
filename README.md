# Measure customer satisfaction with Google Analytics

'happy' is a small HTML widget to measure customer satisfaction and get user feedback. It looks like [this](http://satisfaction.hayonademo.nl). 

You’re free to use it on any page of your site. Just paste the entire content of [widget.html](./blob/master/widget.html) into your page. 

After that you’ll need the Google Tag Manager to push the results into Google Analytics. Need help? [Contact us](http://www.hayona.com/).
